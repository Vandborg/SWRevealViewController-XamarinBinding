## Since I do not have a Xamarin License anymore the project have been discontinued. Feel free to takeover the project if you want. :)

SWRevealViewController-XamarinBinding
=====================================
A UIViewController subclass for revealing a rear (left and/or right) view controller behind a front controller, inspired by the Facebook app, done right!  
I have not made the project this is merely the a XamarinBinding for it. You can find the xcode project here: [SWRevealViewController](https://github.com/John-Lluch/SWRevealViewController)

There is a storyboard Example made by [Viv-Rajkumar](https://github.com/Viv-Rajkumar/)

## Version 0.2 Update

The binding has been updated to use version 2.3.0 of SWRevealViewController and to be compatible with x64 processors. There is one breaking change from 0.1: SWRevealViewController removed the “SWRevealViewControllerSegue” and replaced it with “SWRevealViewControllerSegueSetController”. If you update from 0.1 to 0.2 of this library, you need to adjust your Segues to match this change.
